    <p>Whether you're a goddamn weeb or you're just in the mood for food that actually has vegetables for once, Japanese-style curry is probably a thing you will want to eat at some point. Here is how to make it! The source of this recipe is <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/274077/japanese-curry/">All Recipes</a>, created by MMSVA, who has a cat picture as their avatar. Trustworty! I am using this only for practicing purposes. They know how to cook, probably. Here are the things you'll need!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or more as needed (Do not over oil this -IP)</li>
        <li>1 ¾ pounds beef chuck, cut into 2-inch cubes </li>
        <li>3 onions, quartered (Fewer onions is fine. You won't miss them. You won't miss the onions. -IP)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ketchup (The ketchup helps with it having a ketchupy twang. I have honestly never heard of ketchup in a recipe but this person knows more than me. -IP)</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons Worcestershire sauce (I had to copy-paste this because I couldn't spell it -IP)</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste (Optional) (Okay, fine. -IP)</li>
        <li>water to cover</li>
        <li>4 carrots, cut into 2-inch pieces (The carrots you will miss. Do not skimp on the carrots. -IP)</li>
        <li>1 cube chicken bouillon (Optional) (Do not. -IP)</li>
        <li>3 medium potatoes, cut into 3-inch chunks (Potato that shit up, fam. -IP)</li>
        <li>1 ½ (3.5 ounce) containers Japanese curry roux, or more to taste. (more, because of the taste -IP)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>The Making It Part</h2>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Heat oil in a 6-quart pot over medium-high heat. Add beef and saute until brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onions and cook until starting to soften, about 3 minutes. Add ketchup and Worcestershire sauce. Stir to coat. Add cayenne pepper. Pour in water to cover mixture by 1 or 2 inches. Add carrots and bouillon.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Simmer, skimming fat off the surface of the broth as needed, for 30 minutes. Add potatoes. Stir in 1 package of curry roux and let dissolve; add remaining curry as needed to achieve desired thickness. Continue simmering until beef and vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes more.</li>
    </ul>
