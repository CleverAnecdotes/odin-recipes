    <p>In this economy? You're kidding. Here is a recipe for mostly homemade pizza.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or more as needed (Do not over oil this -IP)</li>
        <li>1 ¾ pounds beef chuck, cut into 2-inch cubes </li>
        <li>3 onions, quartered (Fewer onions is fine. You won't miss them. You won't miss the onions. -IP)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ketchup (The ketchup helps with it having a ketchupy twang. I have honestly never heard of ketchup in a recipe but this person knows more than me. -IP)</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons Worcestershire sauce (I had to copy-paste this because I couldn't spell it -IP)</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste (Optional) (Okay, fine. -IP)</li>
        <li>water to cover</li>
        <li>4 carrots, cut into 2-inch pieces (The carrots you will miss. Do not skimp on the carrots. -IP)</li>
        <li>1 cube chicken bouillon (Optional) (Do not. -IP)</li>
        <li>3 medium potatoes, cut into 3-inch chunks (Potato that shit up, fam. -IP)</li>
        <li>1 ½ (3.5 ounce) containers Japanese curry roux, or more to taste. (more, because of the taste -IP)</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>Now you've got a bunch of stuff! Congratulations on going to the store. Here's the rest of the recipe. Like... the making it part.</p>
    <h2>The Making It Part</h2>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Heat oil in a 6-quart pot over medium-high heat.</li> <li>Add beef and saute until brown, 5 to 7 minutes.</li> <li>Add onions and cook until starting to soften, about 3 minutes.</li> <li>Add ketchup and Worcestershire sauce. Stir to coat. Add cayenne pepper.</li> <li>Pour in water to cover mixture by 1 or 2 inches.</li> <li>Add carrots and bouillon.</li>
        <li>Simmer, skimming fat off the surface of the broth as needed, for 30 minutes.</li> <li>Add potatoes.</li> <li>Stir in 1 package of curry roux and let dissolve; add remaining curry as needed to achieve desired thickness.</li> <li>Continue simmering until beef and vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes more.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Congratulations! It should just about look like food. Assuming you've done it right, you should end up with something that resembles this.</p>

    <p>If it doesn't, then you should probably still try it. How does it taste? Too ketchupy? It'll be fine. Order a pizza.</p>
