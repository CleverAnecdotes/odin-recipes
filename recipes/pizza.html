    <p>In this economy? You're kidding. Here is a recipe for pizza bombs. I haven't eaten these yet! However the recipe from <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/pizza-bombs-recipe-7483839">All Recipes</a> looks really good and also easy to copy and paste. I'm not sponsored, I swear. But hey, All Recipes, hit me up.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) can refrigerated biscuits (such as Pillsbury™ Grands!)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce, or as needed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or as needed (More -IP)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pepperoni, or as needed (More -IP)</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons Worcestershire sauce (I had to copy-paste this because I couldn't spell it -IP)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup melted butter</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>Here you have so many items. Let's combine them into one.</p>
    <h2>Combining Them</h2>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Pop open the biscuit can and divide into 8 biscuits. Flatten each biscuit with your thumb into a 1/8-inch thick circle.</li>
        <li>Spread the center of each circle with about 1 tablespoon pizza sauce, leaving a 1/4-inch edge open. Sprinkle each circle with about 1 tablespoon mozzarella cheese, and about 1 tablespoon pepperoni.</li>
        <li>Pull up the edges of each circle to form a ball, and seal completely. Roll them in your hands to ensure the dough is sealed, then set each ball on the baking sheet seal-side-down.</li>
        <li>Brush each ball with melted butter. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve with additional warmed pizza sauce for dipping.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Great job! You did spherical strombolis! They are probably going to be good.</p>
