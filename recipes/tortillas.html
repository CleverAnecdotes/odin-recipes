    <h1>So, you're tired of Mission Tortillas and you'd like to actually enjoy your tacos.</h1>
    <img src="/recipes/images/Mission-tortillas.jpeg" alt="Mission Tortillas">
    <p>Look, I get it. You want to make some tacos like Taco Cabana, or you can't stand the extra charges at Chipotle anymore. You can do your own damn guac. Here's the recipe for tortillas. This is also given by <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/157642/homemade-flour-tortillas/">All Recipes</a>, which I actually really recommend this time because it's a much better comprehensive instructional.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose Flour: This tortilla recipe, which makes 24 servings (Or a Mexican family of 4 -IP), starts with four cups of all-purpose flour. </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, giving the tortillas a slightly pillowy texture. </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Salt: Salt enhances the overall flavor of the flour tortillas. (Do not forget to salt it. Trust me. -IP)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Lard: Lard, a common baking ingredient in Mexican cuisine, adds flavor and helps create the perfect flour tortilla texture. </li>
        <li>1 Â½ cups Water: Water is essential for gluten development (and gluten development is essential for me -IP), which is essential for structure in the tortillas. </li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>I really like these explanations of why each item is necessary, since it makes it possible to substitute if necessary. Having said that, do not substitute for tortillas. You're trying to make tortillas, not... something else.</p>
    <h2>Making Tortillas, Not Something Else</h2>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a mixing bowl. Rub in lard with your fingers until mixture resembles cornmeal. Add water and mix until dough comes together.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Transfer dough onto a lightly floured surface; knead for a few minutes until smooth and elastic. Divide dough into 24 equal pieces and roll each piece into a ball.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Preheat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Use a well-floured rolling pin to roll a dough ball into a thin, round tortilla. Place into the hot skillet, and cook until bubbly and golden; flip and continue cooking until golden on the other side. Place the cooked tortilla in a tortilla warmer; continue rolling and cooking the remaining dough.</li>
    </ul>
